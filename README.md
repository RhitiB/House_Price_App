# 🏠 House Price Prediction App

A machine learning web app built with **Streamlit** that predicts house prices based on features such as **house age, distance to MRT station, number of convenience stores, latitude, and longitude**.

🚀 **Live Demo**: [Streamlit Cloud App]([https://housepriceapp-b7bqjgcv3jqe4tpbab3f6t.streamlit.app/])

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to:
- Train a **Random Forest Regression** model on a housing dataset.
- Save and load the model using **Pickle**.
- Build an interactive **Streamlit app** for predictions.
- Deploy the app to **Streamlit Community Cloud**.

It is a complete end-to-end ML workflow: **data → model → deployment**.
